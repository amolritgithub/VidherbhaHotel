# VidherbhaHotel
Information About the Hotel
In this project we have build a Spring boot API that uses HTTP requests to access and use data
which allows the Client to directly call the HTTP Services exposed on a Server by sending HTTP 
requests so that data can be used to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data types, which refers to the
reading, updating, creating and deleting of operations concerning resources. In short, REST API 
like Spring Boot REST API can help you retrieve information from another system.
